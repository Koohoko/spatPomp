differences relative to the master branch:
1. handles likelihood estimates differently. Specifically, dmeasure and the guide function are computed on the log scale except when resampling happens. Also, log likelihoods less than tol (default at 1e-300) are not coerced to log(tol).


potential further changes:
1. implement parallelization using the structure of the island particle filtering
2. facilitate multi-dimensional observations on each spatial unit
