\title{Adapted Simulation Island Filter (ASIF)}
\usage{
\S4method{asif}{spatPomp}(object, params, Np, nbhd, islands,
  tol = (1e-18)^9, max.fail = Inf, pred.mean = FALSE,
  pred.var = FALSE, filter.mean = FALSE, filter.traj = FALSE,
  save.states = FALSE, save.params = FALSE,
  verbose = getOption("verbose"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{spatPomp} object.}

\item{params}{A parameter set for the spatiotemporal POMP.}

\item{Np}{The number of particles used within each island for the adapted simulations.}

\item{nbhd}{A function which when given a point in space-time \code{(d,n)} will output a 0-1 matrix of points in space-time considered to be
in the neighborhood of \code{(d,n)}.}

\item{islands}{The number of islands for the adapted simulations.}

\item{tol}{positive numeric scalar;
particles with likelihood less than \code{tol} are considered to be incompatible with the data.
See the section on \emph{Filtering Failures} for more information.}

\item{max.fail}{integer; the maximum number of filtering failures allowed (see below).
If the number of filtering failures exceeds this number, execution will terminate with an error.
By default, \code{max.fail} is set to infinity, so no error can be triggered.}

\item{pred.mean}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the prediction means are calculated for the state variables and parameters.}

\item{pred.var}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the prediction variances are calculated for the state variables and parameters.}

\item{filter.mean}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, the filtering means are calculated for the state variables and parameters.}

\item{filter.traj}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, a filtered trajectory is returned for the state variables and parameters.}

\item{save.states}{logical.
If \code{save.states=TRUE}, the state-vector for each particle at each time is saved.}

\item{verbose}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, diagnostic messages will be printed to the console.}

\item{...}{additional arguments supply new or modify existing model characteristics or components.
See \code{\link{pomp}} for a full list of recognized arguments.

When named arguments not recognized by \code{\link{pomp}} are provided, these are made available to all basic components via the so-called \dfn{userdata} facility.
This allows the user to pass information to the basic components outside of the usual routes of covariates (\code{covar}) and model parameters (\code{params}).
See the \link[=userdata]{userdata documentation here} for information on how to use this facility.}

\value{
Upon successful completion, \code{asif} returns an object of class
\sQuote{asifd.pomp}.

\description{
An algorithm for estimating the filter distribution of a spatiotemporal partially-observed Markov process (SpatPOMP for short).
Running \code{asif} causes the algorithm to run independent island jobs which each yield an imperfect adapted simulation. Simulating from the "adapted filter"
distribution runs into a curse of dimensionality (COD) problem, which is mitigated by keeping particles in each island close to each other through resampling down
to one particle per island at each observation time point.
The adapted simulations are then weighted in a way that tries to avert COD by making a weak coupling assumption to get an approximate filter distribution.
As a by-product, we also get a biased estimate of the likelihood of the data.
