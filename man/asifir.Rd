\title{Adapted Simulation Island Filter with Intermediate Resampling (ASIF-IR)}
\usage{
\S4method{asifir}{spatPomp}(object, params, Np, nbhd, islands,
  tol = (1e-18)^9, max.fail = Inf, save.states = FALSE,
  verbose = getOption("verbose"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{spatPomp} object.}

\item{params}{A parameter set for the spatiotemporal POMP.}

\item{Np}{The number of particles for the adapted simulations within each island.}

\item{nbhd}{A function which when given a point in space-time \code{(d,n)} will output a 0-1 matrix of points in space-time considered to be
in the neighborhood of \code{(d,n)}.}

\item{islands}{The number of islands for the adapted simulations.}

\item{tol}{positive numeric scalar;
particles with likelihood less than \code{tol} are considered to be incompatible with the data.
See the section on \emph{Filtering Failures} for more information.}

\item{max.fail}{integer; the maximum number of filtering failures allowed (see below).
If the number of filtering failures exceeds this number, execution will terminate with an error.
By default, \code{max.fail} is set to infinity, so no error can be triggered.}

\item{save.states}{logical.
If \code{save.states=TRUE}, the state-vector for each particle at each time is saved.}

\item{verbose}{logical; if \code{TRUE}, diagnostic messages will be printed to the console.}

\item{...}{additional arguments supply new or modify existing model characteristics or components.
See \code{\link{pomp}} for a full list of recognized arguments.

When named arguments not recognized by \code{\link{pomp}} are provided, these are made available to all basic components via the so-called \dfn{userdata} facility.
This allows the user to pass information to the basic components outside of the usual routes of covariates (\code{covar}) and model parameters (\code{params}).
See \link[=userdata]{?userdata} for information on how to use this facility.}

\value{
Upon successful completion, \code{asifir} returns an object of class
\sQuote{asifird_spatPomp}.

\description{
An algorithm for estimating the likelihood of a spatiotemporal partially-observed 
Markov process (SpatPOMP for short).
Running \code{asifir} causes the algorithm to run independent island jobs which  
each carry out an adapted simulation using intermediate resampling.
Adapted simulation is an easier task than filtering, since particles in each island
remain close to each other. Intermediate resampling further assists against
the curse of dimensionality (COD) problem for importance sampling.
The adapted simulations are then weighted in a way that tries to avert COD by 
making a weak coupling assumption to get an approximate filter distribution.
As a by-product, we also get an approximation to the likelihood of the data.
