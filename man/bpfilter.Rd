\usage{
\S4method{bpfilter}{spatPomp}(object, Np, block_size, block_list, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{spatPomp} object}

\item{Np}{The number of particles used for the simulations. If missing, \code{bpfilter} will attempt to run using \code{ncol(params)}}

\item{block_size}{The number of spatial units per block.}

\item{block_list}{List that can specifies a partition of the spatial units. Each partition element called a \code{block} and is
an integer vector of neighboring units.}

\item{params}{A parameter set for the spatiotemporal POMP. If missing, \code{bpfilter} will attempt to run using \code{coef(object)}}
}
\value{
Upon successful completion, \code{bpfilter} returns an object of class
\sQuote{bpfilterd_spatPomp}.

\description{
An algorithm used to estimate the filter distribution of a spatiotemporal partially-observed Markov process (spatPomp).
Running \code{bpfilter} causes the algorithm to split the spatial units into different blocks so that each spatial
unit belongs to one block After the particles are propagated, resampling of the particles occurs
within each block independently based on sampled weights within the block Each block samples only the spatial
components within the block which allows for cross-pollination of particles where the highest weighted
components of each particle are more likely to be resampled and get combined with resampled components of other particles.
By using local particle filters and resampling with a smaller subset of dimensions, it tries to avert the curse of dimensionality so that
the resampling does not result in particle depletion with one particle representing the complex filter distribution.

\section{Details}{

Only one of \code{block_size} or \code{block_list} should be specified.
If both or neither is provided, an error is triggered.

\section{Methods}{

The following methods are available for such an object:
\describe{
\item{\code{\link{logLik}}}{ yields an estimate of the log-likelihood of the data under the model. }

\examples{
# Create a simulation of a BM using default parameter set
b <- bm(U=6, N=10)

# Run BPF with the specified number of particles and number of units per block
bpfilterd.b1 <- bpfilter(b, Np = 100, block_size = 2)

# Run BPF with the specified number of particles and partition (block list). This specification
is exactly equivalent to the previous example
bpfilterd.b2 <- bpfilter(b, Np = 20, block_list = list(c(1,2), c(3,4), c(5,6)))

# Get a likelihood estimate
logLik(bpfilterd.b2)
