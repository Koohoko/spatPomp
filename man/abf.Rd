\usage{
\S4method{abf}{spatPomp}(object, Nrep, Np, nbhd, params, tol = (1e-300), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{spatPomp} object.}

\item{Np}{The number of particles used within each replicate for the adapted simulations.}

\item{nbhd}{A neighborhood function with three arguments: \code{object}, \code{time} and \code{unit}. The function should return a \code{list} of two-element vectors. The list output of
\code{nbhd(u,n)} consists of vectors \code{c(a,b)} where \eqn{(a,b)} is a neighbor of \code{(u,n)} in space-time.}

\item{params}{A parameter set for the spatiotemporal POMP. If missing, \code{abf} will attempt to run using \code{coef(object)}}

\item{tol}{If the resampling weight for a particle is zero due to floating-point precision issues, it is set to the value of \code{tol} since resampling has to be done.}

\item{Nreplicates}{The number of replicates for the adapted simulations.}
}
\value{
Upon successful completion, \code{abf} returns an object of class
\sQuote{abfd_spatPomp}.
}
\description{
An algorithm for estimating the filter distribution and likelihood estimate of a spatiotemporal partially-observed Markov process model.
Running \code{abf} causes the algorithm to run bootstrap replicate jobs which each yield an imperfect adapted simulation. Simulating from the "adapted filter"
distribution runs into a curse of dimensionality (COD) problem, which is mitigated by keeping particles in each replicate close to each other through resampling down
to one particle per replicate at each observation time point.
The adapted simulations are then weighted in a way that tries to avert COD by making a weak coupling assumption to get an approximate filter distribution.
As a by-product, we also get a biased estimate of the likelihood of the data.

\section{Methods}{

The following methods are available for such an object:

\examples{
# Create a simulation of a BM using default parameter set
b <- bm(U=3, N=10)

# Create a neighborhood function mapping a point in space-time to a list of "neighboring points" in space-time
bm_nbhd <- function(object, time, unit) {
  nbhd_list = list()
  if(time > 1 && unit > 1) nbhd_list = c(nbhd_list, list(c(unit - 1, time - 1)))
  return(nbhd_list)
}

# Run ABF specified number of Monte Carlo islands and particles per island
abfd.b <- abf(b, islands = 50, Np = 10, nbhd = bm_nbhd)

# Get the likelihood estimate from ABF
logLik(abfd.b)

# Compare with the likelihood estimate from Particle Filter
pfd.b <- pfilter(b, Np = 500)
logLik(pfd.b)
